# C9E2-AccountPersonalAcctBusinessAcct
Create PersonalAcct and BusinessAcct classes that inherit the Account class presented in Chapter 8.  A personal account requires a minimum balance of $100. If the balance falls below this amount, then  $2.00 is charged (withdrawn) to the account. A business account requires a minimum balance of $500,  otherwise the account is charged $10. Create client code to test the classes.
